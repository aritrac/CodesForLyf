/**
 * Given a positive integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. More formally, check if N can be expressed as
 * 2x for some x.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: N = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 1 is equal to 2 raised to 0 (20 == 1).
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: N = 98
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * 98 cannot be obtained by any power of 2.
 *
 * Your Task: Your task is to complete the function isPowerofTwo() which takes n as a parameter and returns true or
 * false by checking is given number can be represented as a power of two or not.
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= N <= 1018
