/**
 * Given an unsigned integer N. The task is to swap all odd bits with even bits. For example, if the given number is
 * 23 (00010111), it should be converted to 43(00101011). Here, every even position bit is swapped with adjacent bit on
 * the right side(even position bits are highlighted in the binary representation of 23), and every odd position bit is
 * swapped with an adjacent on the left side.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: N = 23
 * Output: 43
 * Explanation:
 * Binary representation of the given number
 * is 00010111 after swapping
 * 00101011 = 43 in decimal.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: N = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Binary representation of the given number
 * is 10 after swapping 01 = 1 in decimal.
 *
 * Your Task: Your task is to complete the function swapBits() which takes an integer and returns an integer with all
 * the odd and even bits swapped.
 *
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109
